## Why Python for Data Science?

Python is one of the most powerful and widely used languages in the field of data science due to:

- **Easy syntax and readability**
- Rich ecosystem of **libraries** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.)
- Strong community support
- Excellent for **data manipulation, analysis, visualization, machine learning**, and **automation**

Whether you're processing data, building ML models, or visualizing insights, Python makes every step intuitive and scalable.
